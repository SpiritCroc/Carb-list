# Name:

Personal Carb-list


# Short description:

Make notes about the carb values of your food and use them to calculate.


# Description:

Create a list of all your collected carbohydrate values and use them to calculate.
(If you want to use a different unit than 'carb', you can configure it in the settings!)

Each entry can save the following values:
- Name
- Weight/carb
- Carb/piece
- Comment
- Confirmed (Set to false in case you want to mark this entry in order to show that you are not sure whether your entered values work)
Of course, you can change all values afterwards.

You don't have to know the weight per one carb / the carbs per one piece, just enter the numbers you know and the app will do the calculating.

After adding entries, you can use them to calculate.

No idea what to eat? The app can also select and show a random entry to give you some inspiration.
